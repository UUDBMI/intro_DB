Module instructions:
Part1_DB_classprep describes how to get set up. I expect that students will open a new terminal window and run queries from there. The git clone command that copied these files into the work directory should have also copied the database.

Part2_DB_SQL has links to videos and practice

If students prefer to work within Python, there is a version of Part 2 that uses Pandas
